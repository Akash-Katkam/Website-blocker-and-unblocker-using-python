About Website Blocker:
Website blockers are software programs that are used to block any websites on the internet and prevent us from accessing them. They are most widely used as browser extensions that “Blacklist” websites for you so that you cannot see the results from those websites. But here, we are going to create a program that blocks websites and you cannot access those blocked websites.
